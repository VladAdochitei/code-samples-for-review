# py-flask-chat-app-enhanced
This is an application I worked in the past as part of a project assignment at my Master's. It resemples a simple chatting application written in Python Flask, with socket integration, persistence and a few tests. I have also decided to leave the TODO section which show what work I think still needed to be performed on that application.


Enhanced chatting application, project based on [py-flask-chat-app](https://github.com/VladAdochitei/py-flask-chat-app).


## TODO:
- Add persistence of messages via database.
- Add Authentication
- Make the UI better
